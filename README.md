Your task is to follow the folder structures given and build them out completely inside Visual Studio. I will provide you with a folder structure to create. There will be **five levels**, starting at level 1 and moving up each level till you get to level 5. 

Before starting each level, navigate into the task_description folder. Open the README.md file for that level and read the instructions carefully. To preview the file in Markdown format, right-click on the README.md file and select “View Preview”.
